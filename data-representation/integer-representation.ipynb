If multiple bytes, for example the 4 bytes for a 32-bit integer, we have explained that the address will be a multiple of 4, and the bytes will the 4 bytes at that address, one, two and three plus that address. Given an integer varible in C, `int i`, then address-of operator returns a slightly abstract item called a point-to-int, or int star, or `int *`, that can be used to find the integer `i` in memory.\n",
