    "It is possible that the 8 bit byte was influenced by the need for a byte to signify one text character.

There were also _control characters_, which are non-printing characters that are sent in the character stream such as,\n",

    "Soon the issue arose of representing an expanded collection of alphabets. A variety of systems were invented to accomodate these characters. \n",

    "The question is how to store these character streams so that older 8 bit code is compatible with newere 16 bit codes, or perhaps codes of intermediate sizes. The answer appeared on a napkin in a New Jersey diner where Rob Pike and Ken Thompson were eating, and it became the standard UTF-8.\n",

    "If 11 bits of code space is needed, then 2 bytes are used in a sequence. Of the 16 bits available in 2 bytes, 5 of them are used to indicate that this is a two byte sequence. The first of the two uses the top 3 bits to indicate this is exactly a 2 byte sequence, and the byte following is the second in the sequence. The byte following uses the top 2 bits to mark that this byte is part of a sequence.\n",
