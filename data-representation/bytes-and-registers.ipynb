    "Computers have mechanisms for memory, computation, and communication. In this section we look at memory. The basic building blocks of memory in the modern computer are the _register_ and the _byte_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The byte is the basic building block the Random Access Memory (RAM), which is the focus of most dicussions about memory. It is fast, large, and easily accessed. A _bit_ is a storage element that can be one of two states, we will call them 0 or 1. A _byte_ is 8 bits together with each bit having its place in the byte, from the 0-th bit to the 7-th bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "That the byte has 8 bits is so common that I will just define a byte to be 8 bits, but in fact, early computers had diferent lenghts of bytes. For various reasons, 8 turned out the just the right size for the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytes are collected into a large, enummerated array called the RAM memory. Each byte in the array is known by its number in this array, called the byte's _address_. That each byte is equally accessible regardless of its address gives rise to the name _random_ access memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "__N.B.:__ This is mostly true. So much depends on the speed of RAM that there are techniques that make memory accesss faster by not uniformly accross all bytes. Examples are caches and NUMA machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several useful consequences of having integer addresses,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some data items need to be built from multiple bytes. By using addresses in sequence the address of the item and all its components are easiliy determined.\n",
    "- Some data items are in repeating multiples, and integer arithmetic can be used for these items to offest to the particular item in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that a byte has 256 possibel different bit combinations. This is often assocated with the integers 0 through 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A _register_ is a a number $n$ of bits taken together where each bit has its location in the collection, from bit 0 up to bit $n-1$. In this sense it generalizes the byte. However registers are found in the CPU and are addressed differently. Some register (the _Instrution Pointer_ (IP) and the _Stack Pointer_ (SP)) are known intrinsicly to some instructions executed by the CPU. Some are named, some are indexed by an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "However a typical size for a register on a 64 bit machine is 64 bits. Older machine had small registers. The Intel 8085, in the early 1980's, had 16 bit registers. They were quicly enough replaced by such machines as the Intel 8086 with 32 bit registers. In this case, for backwards compatibility, each 32 register also can be identified by the upper and lower halves as 16 bit registers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=basenotation>Binary and other notations</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of binary was basically practical. The bit state would be based on some physical phenomena, and so there would be noise. A binary indicator can be made very tolerant of noise but having a threshold in the reading of the phenomena so that about the threashod is a 1, and below a 0. The noise amounts woud not matter as long as the noise amplitude kept the intended signal on the proper side of the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the correspondence between the bit pattern and an integer can be made completely natural thorugh the binary representation of the integer value. Recall that a number $n$  can be represented as a collection of zero-one values, $b_i$ by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n = \\sum_i b_i \\, 2^i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the byte, the bits are assigned their bit number, giving the $b_i$ that is to appear in this equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a byte is an integer that has exactly 8 $b_i$. We will follow C language syntax and indicate a binary number by prefixing a 0-1 string with the indicatior `0b`. The number 5 in binary is `0b101`. However thinking about a byte it is best to visualize this written as `0b0000010`, accounting for all 8 bits in the byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we see how tedious it is to write numbers in binary, although they suit the hardware just fine. Instead, when trying to thing about an integer in terms of which bits are 1 and which are 0, the number is better written in base 16, known as _hexidecimal_. It is pretty important for a computer scientist to know hexidecimal, so I hope to give you some exericses to practice this number notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexidecimal is base 16, hence there must be 16 \"digits\" for each place, and these are, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fillow C language syntax and indicate a hexidecimal number by prefixing the string of thise hex-its with the indicator `0x`. The number 5 in hexidecimal is `0x5`, However thinking about a byte it is best to write this as `0x05`, so all 8 bits are accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call _register_ the notion of a byte, but of any length. This is novel language, except that it is consistent with the name _registers_ are is it used in CPU architectures. When data is stored in a CPU it is stored in a CPU register. A 16 bit register (Intel 8085) it can store numbers from `0x0000` to `0xffff` (0 to 65,536).\n"

    "A bit can be represented by any manner in which there can be a distinction between two states. Here we see an early data storage strategy with a paper tape. Each column across the tape was a 5 bit byte, and it locations marked off in 5-th way from edge to edge, a hole was a 1 and no hoe was a 0. The 5 bit byte was supported by an early code called the [Baudot code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code), invented by Emile Baudot in 1870. Its 32 different combinations barely fit enough symbols to be useful. While the Baudo code is obsolete, the word _baud_ is still with us, and it refers to the number of symbols per second in a communication channel.\n",

The remaining 3 bits are parity bits and support the error correction.\n",
