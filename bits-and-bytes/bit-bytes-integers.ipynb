I some memories it whether a particular small region in silicon wafer has a charge or not; for \"spinning rust\" hard drives it was whether a small section of magnitizable material was magnitized north polarity or south polarity. The ancient data storage device the punched tape memorialized the zero/one as the presence or not of a hole in a precise location on a paper tape.\n",

    "We have shown that the computer can represent integers in binary, and have discussed so far only bytes. Since bytes have only 256 bit patterns, they can only store a small range of integers. So far we have shown how it can store the integers 0 through 255. There are two deficiencies,\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must be able to store much larger intergers\n",
    "- We must be able to represent both positive and negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "C Language has two data types for integers, _signed_ and _unsigned_. The type _unsigned char_ is one byte and the various bit patterns are used to represent the integers 0 through 255, using the obvious binary representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We set aside for now the representation of negative numbers, and address that we would like a much larger range of positive numbers represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "To store larger numbers the computer will use more bytes, and will collect them so that they have consecutive adresses in the RAM. This way, the location of the integer remains a single address. The number of bytes is known because the reference has a type that includes the number of bytes. \n",

However, 32 bits is the standard integer, with type names `int` and `unsigned int`. The image is from TCPL first edition, where they give the number of bits in the various integer and byte types of computers of that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were then two variants of `int`, the `short int` and the `long int`. The actual number of bytes is not defined in the C Language, except that a short int cannot be longer than an int, and a long int cannot be shorter than an int. Let's say for normality that a short is 16 bits and a long is 64 bits. Beware though, this will depend on the computer and the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The builtin operator `sizeof` gives the number of bytes of the object mentioned as its argument. The argument can be a data type or a variable. Although `sizeof` looks like a function call, it is not. If it were a function call, we would have to wait until the prgram ran before the value of `sizeof` is known. It is already known at compile time.\n"

    "### The memory layout of integers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn something about computer architectures and something about the C programming language together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have described how an integer is stored in a computer using multiple bytes, and for the convenience of the hardware those bytes will be in consecutive locations in the memory. They will also be at memory locations, when the index is considered as a integer, the multiple of the data type size. We will demonstrated this, but with a little hackery.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also said that the memory unit consists of an array of bytes, each with an index, in fact, an integer. In many C language situations, we can actualize this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a memory item, say the integer `int i`, as a 32-bit integer is occupies four addresses in memory, say $m, m+1, m+2, m+3$. The notation `&i` gives a _pointer_ to `i`, which is an abstract memory reference, which in this case would be of type _pointer to an int_, or in C notation `int *` (said \"int-star\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a grave error to confuse a memory pointer with an integer, the \"location\" of the byte or the starting location of bytes, with a pointer. But we will do just that, by coercing the pointer to an _unsigned long int_. We need it to be unsigned, as there are no negative indexed locations in memory, and long, as most computers now are said to be 64-bit machines, meaning that their potential memory space is $2^{64}$ locations. Now no computer today actualizes this, but it actualizes some amount of that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "To look at the memory for a single integer type data item, be it short, int or long, we will consider an _array_ of integers. This is a sequence of several data items identified with the name of the array and an integer indicating whether we are considering the zeroth, first, second, third, etc, item along the array of items. C lays these out sequentially in memory so that the $i$-th element is easy to find from the location of the zero-th element and the size (number of bytes) for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "It packs these in tightly. So if we define a two element array of int, the integer address of the zero-th element and that of the first element should be separated by the `sizeof` of the element. "
